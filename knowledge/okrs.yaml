simple_explanation: >
  Think of a road trip. The 'Objective' is the destination (e.g., 'Get to the Grand Canyon'). The 'Key Results' are the measurable signposts that prove you're on track (e.g., 'Drive 500 miles,' 'Cross the Arizona state line'). The Key Results are the numbers that show you're actually getting closer to your goal.
