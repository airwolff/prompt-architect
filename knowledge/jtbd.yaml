  People don't buy a drill because they want a drill; they buy it because they want a quarter-inch hole to hang a picture. The 'job' isn't owning a drill, it's the feeling of satisfaction from seeing the picture on the wall. This theory says innovators should focus on helping people achieve that 'job' better, not just on building a better drill.
