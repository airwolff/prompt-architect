description: What structured prompting frameworks can be used to guide the AI through complex tasks like creative brainstorming, problem-solving, or narrative generation?
core_components:
  - name: "RISEN (In-depth Analysis)"
    description: "A framework for directing AI models to go beyond surface-level advice and think critically and creatively for more in-depth responses."
  - name: "BAB (Persuasive Narrative)"
    description: "Uses storytelling (Before, After, Bridge) to connect a user's current problem to a desired solution."
  - name: "Tree of Thought (ToT) (Complex Problem-Solving)"
    description: "Directs the model to explore multiple reasoning paths simultaneously, mimicking human decision-making."
  - name: "RASCEF (Comprehensive Master Template)"
    description: "A comprehensive template that combines all core components of a detailed prompt (Role, Action, Steps, Context, Examples, Format)."
  - name: "Six Thinking Hats (Multi-perspective Analysis)"
    description: "A method for looking at a decision or problem from six distinct perspectives to ensure a well-rounded analysis."
  - name: "SCAMPER (Creative Brainstorming)"
    description: "A creative brainstorming technique that uses a checklist of seven questions to develop or improve a product or idea."
mechanism_and_use:
  - name: "Applying a Framework"
    description: "Instead of building a prompt from scratch with the five core components, you select a pre-defined framework like BAB or Six Thinking Hats when the task aligns with its specific use case."
  - name: "Framework Example (Six Thinking Hats)"
    description: "To generate a balanced analysis of a business proposal, you would guide the AI with prompts for each hat: White (facts), Red (emotions), Black (risks), Yellow (benefits), Green (alternatives), and Blue (process)."
connections_and_applications:
  description: "Frameworks provide a structured, advanced alternative to the basic core components for guiding the AI through specific, well-defined types of tasks."

simple_explanation: >
  Frameworks are like special recipes for specific kinds of questions. If you want to tell a story, you use the BAB recipe. If you want to analyze a problem from all sides, you use the Six Thinking Hats recipe. They give you a proven step-by-step guide.
